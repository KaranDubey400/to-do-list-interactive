HELLO IT'S ME KARAN DUBEY 
I HAVE CREATED THIS TO-DO LIST AS A PART OF INTERNSHIP 

* I HAVE USED HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT ,

IT LETS YOU LIST YOUR DAY TO DAY TASKS , 
I HAVE ADDED FEW FUNCTIONALITIES

TASK ARE LISTED ON THE BASIS OF DEADLINE AND PRIORITY 
TOP PRIORITY TASKS ARE ON THE TOP FOLLOWED BY MEDIUM AND THEN LOW PRIORITY TASKS 
THIS PROVIDES USERS A FEATURE TO LIST TASKS ACCORDING TO THE PRIORITY , 

TOP PRIORITY TASKS ARE MARKED WITH PNK COLOR 
MEDIUM WITH PURPLE 
LOW WITH LIGHT COLOR YELLOWISH 


* PROVIDES YOU A OPTION TO DELETE THE TASK WHENEVER COMPLETED OR WHEN YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE 
TASK 

TO ADD A TASK, JUST SELECT THE PRIORITY LEVEL FOR YOUR TASK THAN WRITE THE TASK
AND MENTION THE DEADLINE AND CLICK ON THE ADD  TASK BUTTON , IT WILL 
AUTOMATICALLY GET LISTED IN THE TO-DO LIST ,


*THIS CAN INCREASE YOUR WORK BY ALOT ,AND IT;S BETTER THAN YOU NORMAL TO-DO LIST APP 

CREATED WITH LOVE AND PURPOSE TO HELP YOU
